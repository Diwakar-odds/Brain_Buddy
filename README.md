# Brain Buddy - AI-Powered Neuroplasticity Trainer

> A neuro-algorithmic symbiosis: Training your brain through adaptive AI, generative content, and neuroscience-based protocols.

## 🧠 Vision

Brain Buddy is not just another wellness app—it's a **Closed-Loop Neuro-Cybernetic System** that learns from you to teach you. By combining cutting-edge neuroscience with continual learning AI, we create a personalized brain training platform that evolves with your neural patterns.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. MOVERS Morning Ritual
- **M**editate: AI-generated ambient soundscapes
- **O**xygenate: Guided breathwork exercises
- **V**isualize: Personalized mental rehearsal scripts
- **E**xercise: Adaptive movement suggestions
- **R**ead: Curated neuroscience insights
- **S**cribe: Digital journaling with prompts

### 2. Brainwave Training Studio
- Target specific brain states (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- Generative music with embedded entrainment frequencies
- Binaural beats & isochronic tones
- Real-time personalization via RLHF

### 3. PFC Gym (Prefrontal Cortex Training)
- **Procrastination Breaker**: 2-minute state-shift protocols
- **Habit Rewiring**: Interrupt negative loops
- **Emotional Regulation**: Strengthen top-down control

### 4. Mental Rehearsal Lab
- Guided visualization for skill acquisition
- Based on Pascual-Leone piano experiment
- Multisensory, specific, emotionally-engaged scripts

### 5. Chronotype Optimizer
- Personalized daily schedule aligned with your biology
- Optimize deep work, creative work, and rest periods

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

### Neuroplasticity
- **Structural**: AutoProg AI mirrors neurogenesis
- **Functional**: Generative Replay mirrors memory consolidation

### Dual-Process Brain
- **Limbic Module**: Fast, emotional processing
- **PFC Module**: Slow, analytical reasoning
- Train the "neural seesaw" for better self-regulation

### Brainwave Entrainment
- Frequency-following effect to modulate brain states
- Transparent about mixed scientific evidence
- User-driven experimentation and tracking

## 🤖 AI Architecture

### Continual Learning
- **OCL-PDS Framework**: Handles Progressive Distribution Shift
- **Hybrid Approach**: AutoProg (structural) + Generative Replay (functional)
- **Self-KD**: Self-Knowledge Distillation for efficiency

### Generative Engine
- **Music**: VAE/GAN for real-time composition
- **Scripts**: LLM-based visualization generation
- **Verification**: Hybrid (RLHF + rule-based)

### Personalization
- **RLHF Loop**: Learn from user feedback
- **Progressive Adaptation**: Model evolves with user
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent AI capabilities
